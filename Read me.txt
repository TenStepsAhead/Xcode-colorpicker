Hex Color Picker 1.6 source readme
http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/

Information
===========

Hex Color Picker is a "color picker", a plugin-like bundle for the
Mac OS X standard color panel. For more information, see this:

<http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DrawColor/index.html>

The Xcode project contains one build configuration for 10.4 (Tiger) and one for 10.5 and higher (Leopard and Snow Leopard). 10.4 builds PowerPC+Intel Universal. 10.5+ builds 4-way Universal (32-bit + 64-bit) and supports running under GC and manual memory management. 

No build configuration will install into ~/Library/ColorPickers on build.


A note on localizations
=======================

To save space, no localizations are included in this source release.
They are actually applied to the product of the build to support an
uncluttered Xcode project. (There's no "localization source" - just
peruse the localizations in the latest binary release.)
